I am a Manchester-based Data Scientist with the BBC. This website serves as a place to document my roles and experience to date and also to make notes on interesting and new topics that I come across.

My background is in applied statistics with a focus on environmental applications. My PhD thesis described novel statistical methods for modelling the long-term risk of extratropical cyclones in Europe, with potential benefits for the insurance industry. Since then I worked in engineering consultancy before moving to the BBC where I have been using machine learning applied to large audience consumption datasets.

I am an avid runner with an aim to complete the York marathon in 2020. I also enjoy cooking, reading and politics. I am currently (finally) learning how to play chess.
